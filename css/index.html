    <p class="indent">Fortnite's story revolves around the Zero Point, a nexus of all realities and dimensions, which the Imagined Order (IO)
    exploits to create a recurring "Loop," forcing people to fight for survival and memory loss. The Seven, a group of

    through live events and new Chapters, featuring character-driven storylines, interdimensional rifts, and the involvement
    of figures like Agent Jones and other realities' heroes.
